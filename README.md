# Weather-Page

Just something for fun and to work on my React-Native skills. Going to try to
make a new tiny project every week!

# How to run locally

1) Clone this repo into a local directory on your machine, you'll
   need to replace KEY in App.js with your api key from OpenWeatherMap API
2) Make sure you have expo installed on your machine (if not,
   go to https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/
   for instructions)
3) Make sure you have the Expo Go app installed on your phone
4) In the same local directory on your machine, run `expo start` (note 
   that some versions of node won't work with expo, personally I switch
   to node v16.15.0 when running this command)
5) You should see a QR code pop up, scan this using the camera
   on your phone and it will open the app on your phone!

Note: It may take a second for data to appear because the API
call takes awhile :((
