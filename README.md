# Weather-Page

Just something for fun and to work on my React-Native skills. Going to try to
make a new tiny project every week!

# How to run locally

1) Pull this code into a local directory on your machine
2) Make sure you have expo installed on your machine (if not,
   go to https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/
   for instructions)
3) Make sure you have the Expo Go app installed on your phone
4) In the same local directory on your machine, run `expo start`
5) You should see a QR code pop up, scan this using the camera
   on your phone and it will open the app on your phone!

Note: It may take a second for data to appear because the API
call takes awile :((
